# Data_Science_Portfolio
A Portfolio of my Data Science Projects

I am an aspiring data scientist with 3 years of professional data analytics experience. This repository is used to track my projects, progress, and learning goals.  It is updated on a regular basis. The projects are written in Python using Anaconda Spyder. 

I'm currently enrolled in "Introduction to Analytics Modeling" offered by Georgia Tech thru edX. After completing this course, I am hoping to obtain admission into Georgia Tech's Online Master's of Science in Analytics program.

Please see my resume for an up-to-date summary of my professional experience.


# Projects

C-Support Vector Classification:
Credit_card_data-headers.txt contains a dataset with 654 data points, 6 continuous and 4 binary predictor variables. It
has anonymized credit card applications with a binary response variable (last column) indicating if the
application was positive or negative. The dataset is the “Credit Approval Data Set” from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Credit+Approval) without the categorical
variables and without data points that have missing values.

Deliverable:
Perform classification on samples in X
Return the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels
