A Portfolio of my Data Science Projects

I am an aspiring data scientist with 3 years of professional data analytics experience. This repository is used to track my projects, progress, and learning goals.  It is updated on a regular basis. The projects are written in Python using Anaconda Spyder. 

I'm currently enrolled in "Introduction to Analytics Modeling" offered by Georgia Tech thru edX. After completing this course, I am hoping to obtain admission into Georgia Tech's Online Master's of Science in Analytics program.

Please see my resume for an up-to-date summary of my professional experience.
